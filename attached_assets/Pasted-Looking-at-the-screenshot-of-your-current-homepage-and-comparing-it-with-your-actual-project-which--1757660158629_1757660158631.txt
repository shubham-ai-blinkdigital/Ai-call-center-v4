Looking at the screenshot of your current homepage and comparing it with your actual project (which is a Flowchart Builder for AI Call Systems), I can see several major issues that need to be addressed:

üîç Current Homepage Analysis - Key Problems:
1. Misleading Brand Identity
Current: Shows "Blink.ai" branding
Reality: Your project is a Flowchart Builder/Call Flow Creator
Issue: Users expect a drag-and-drop flowchart tool, not generic AI chat
2. Wrong Core Messaging
Current: "Transform Customer Conversations with AI" (generic AI platform)
Should Be: "Build AI Call Flows Visually" or "Drag-and-Drop Call Flow Builder"
Issue: Doesn't communicate the unique flowchart building capability
3. Incorrect Feature Cards
Current: Generic AI solutions (Voice AI, Chat AI, Agent Assistance)
Should Be:
Visual Flow Builder
Phone Number Management
Call Analytics
Team Collaboration
4. Misleading Use Cases Section
Current: Customer Support, Sales, Outbound Campaigns (generic)
Should Be:
Lead Qualification Flows
Customer Service Routing
Appointment Booking Systems
5. Wrong Stats Display
Current: Generic AI performance metrics
Should Be:
Flows Created
Active Phone Numbers
Successful Calls
User Teams
6. Outdated Testimonials
Current: Generic AI customer feedback
Should Be: Users talking about ease of building flows, visual interface benefits
7. Missing Core Value Proposition
Missing: The key differentiator that users can visually build call flows without coding
Missing: Integration with phone systems and call routing
Missing: Team collaboration features for flow management
üéØ Recommended Content Strategy:
Hero Section Should Focus On:
"Build AI Call Flows Visually"
"No-Code Call Flow Designer"
Screenshot of the actual flowchart builder interface
Feature Cards Should Highlight:
Visual Flow Builder - Drag and drop interface
Phone Integration - Connect real phone numbers
Team Management - Collaborate on call flows
Analytics Dashboard - Track call performance
Use Cases Should Show:
Lead Qualification - Route calls based on responses
Customer Routing - Direct to right department
Appointment Booking - Automated scheduling flows
The current homepage completely misrepresents what your application actually does. Users coming to your site expect a visual flowchart building tool for creating call systems, not a generic AI conversation platform.

Would you like me to proceed with creating a new, accurate homepage that properly represents your flowchart builder application?
