Looking at your database schema and the current deployment error, I can see the issue clearly. Let me analyze the situation and provide you with a comprehensive plan.

Current Problem Analysis
From the console logs, I can see the main issue:

Error fetching pathways: error: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "test-user-1"
The problem is that some code is still trying to use "test-user-1" as a user ID, but your database expects proper UUIDs. The authenticated user actually has the correct UUID: f42a2757-ccb6-4f1e-ab99-56769b12089c.

Database Schema Understanding
Based on your screenshots, here's what I see:

Users Table:

id (UUID, Primary Key)
email, name, company, role, phone_number
created_at, updated_at, last_login
password_hash
Phone Numbers Table:

id (UUID, Primary Key)
user_id (UUID, Foreign Key to users)
purchased_at, pathway_id (UUID)
location, subscription_plan, phone_number
Pathways Table:

id (UUID, Primary Key) - This is the pathway_id you mentioned
name, description (VARCHAR/TEXT)
team_id, creator_id, updater_id (UUIDs)
created_at, updated_at
data (JSONB) - This stores the flowchart data
phone_number_id (UUID, Foreign Key to phone_numbers)
pathway_id (UUID, UNIQUE) - This seems redundant with the primary key id
Plan to Fix the Deployment Issues
Phase 1: Fix Authentication & User ID Issues
Fix /api/pathways route - Remove the hardcoded "test-user-1" and properly use the authenticated user's UUID
Update components that fetch pathways - Ensure they use the authenticated user's ID correctly
Fix phone number lookup - The lookup-pathway API is searching for +114158552898 but the database has +14158552898
Phase 2: Fix Data Flow & Pathway Management
Fix pathway saving - The save-flowchart API is failing because it can't find the phone number for the user
Update pathway loading - Ensure pathways are loaded using the correct pathway.id as the identifier
Fix relationship between phone numbers and pathways - Based on your schema, it looks like you have both phone_numbers.pathway_id and pathways.phone_number_id which suggests a relationship flip that might not be fully implemented
Phase 3: Data Consistency
Ensure phone number format consistency - All phone numbers should be stored in the same format (e.g., +14158552898)
Verify pathway data structure - Make sure the data JSONB column properly stores and retrieves flowchart data
Fix pathway identification - Use pathways.id as the primary identifier consistently
Phase 4: Frontend Updates
Update "My Pathways" page - Ensure it displays pathways using the correct pathway.id
Fix pathway editor - Make sure it can load and save pathway data using the correct identifiers
Update recent flows component - Fix the API calls to work with authenticated users
Specific Issues I've Identified
Auth Context Issues: Some components are getting "test-user-1" instead of the real UUID
Phone Number Format: Database has +14158552898 but lookups search for +114158552898
API Parameter Inconsistency: Some APIs expect creator_id parameter, others get it from auth token
Pathway-Phone Relationship: The relationship between pathways and phone numbers seems to have both directions which is causing confusion
Next Steps
The deployment will work once we:

Fix the hardcoded "test-user-1" references
Ensure proper phone number formatting consistency
Make sure all pathway operations use the correct pathway.id from your database schema
Fix the authentication flow to consistently provide the correct user UUID
