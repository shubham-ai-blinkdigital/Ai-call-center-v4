Yes, I understand your requirement perfectly! Let me break down what you want to add:

Understanding Your Requirement:
New Node Type: Webhook Node

1. Input Fields:
Name: Text input for naming the webhook node
Webhook Section: A comprehensive API configuration section with:
HTTP Method dropdown (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
URL input field
Authorization toggle/section
Headers toggle/section
Body toggle/section
Timeout setting (in seconds)
Retry Attempts setting
"Reroute through server" toggle
"Test API Request" button
Response Data toggle/section
"Pathway After API Request Response" dropdown/section
2. UI Requirements:
The webhook configuration UI should match the style shown in your attached image
Clean, organized layout with collapsible sections
Toggle switches for optional features
Proper form inputs and validation
3. Backend Integration:
Update the convertReactFlowToBland function in reactflow-converter.ts to handle the new webhook node type
Generate appropriate JSON structure that Bland.ai can understand for webhook nodes
What I Need to Implement:
New Webhook Node Component (webhook-node.tsx)
Add Webhook Node to Node Palette (update node-palette.tsx)
Update Node Editor Drawer (add webhook-specific fields to node-editor-drawer.tsx)
Update Flowchart Canvas (register the new node type in flowchart-canvas.tsx)
Update ReactFlow Converter (handle webhook node in reactflow-converter.ts)
Questions Before Implementation:
Webhook Node Behavior: Should this webhook node:

Make the API call during the conversation flow?
Use the response data to influence the conversation path?
Store the response in variables for later use?
Default Values: What should be the default values for:

HTTP method (GET?)
Timeout (10 seconds?)
Retry attempts (0?)
Color Scheme: What color should the webhook node be? (I see you have green for greeting, blue for question, yellow for customer response, purple for transfer, red for end call)

Bland.ai Integration: Do you have specific requirements for how this webhook node should be formatted in the JSON that gets sent to Bland.ai? Any specific field names or structure they expect?

Error Handling: How should the node behave if the webhook call fails? Should there be a fallback path or error handling configuration?

Once you confirm these details, I'll implement the complete webhook node functionality!
