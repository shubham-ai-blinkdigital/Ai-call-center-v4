Looking at your attached file and current code, I understand you want to change from fetching external API data to using a 2-step Twilio + Bland.ai integration flow. Let me explain the process and differences:

Current Flow vs. Proposed Flow
Current Flow (What you have now):
User visits /purchase → Fetch from external mock API → Display available numbers → Purchase via PayPal
Proposed Flow (From your attached file):
User searches with filters → Fetch real Twilio numbers → User selects → Purchase via Bland.ai API → Store in your DB
Key Differences & Process Explanation
1. Search Step (New)
Current: No search, just shows pre-fetched numbers
Proposed: Add search filters (area code, region, country) to query Twilio's real available numbers
API: Use Twilio's availablePhoneNumbers API to get real available numbers
2. Data Source Change
Current: https://v0-mock-phone-number-api.vercel.app/api/bland-ai/available-numbers (mock data)
Proposed: Twilio API client.availablePhoneNumbers(countryCode).local.list() (real data)
3. Purchase Method Change
Current: PayPal subscription for mock numbers
Proposed: Direct API call to https://api.bland.ai/numbers/purchase with the selected Twilio number
4. Required Environment Variables
You'll need to add:

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
BLAND_API_KEY=your_bland_api_key
Implementation Plan
Step 1: Replace the current /api/bland-ai/available-numbers/route.ts
Remove external API fetch
Add Twilio SDK integration
Return real Twilio numbers instead of mock data
Step 2: Update the purchase flow
Replace PayPal integration with Bland.ai API call
Create new /api/bland-ai/purchase-number/route.ts
Store purchased numbers in your PostgreSQL database
Step 3: Add search functionality (optional enhancement)
Add search form with area code, region filters
Update the purchase page to include search capabilities
Benefits of This Change
Real Numbers: Get actual available Twilio numbers instead of mock data
Proper Integration: Direct integration with Bland.ai's number provisioning
Better UX: Users see real available numbers they can actually purchase
Database Storage: Properly store purchased numbers in your existing PostgreSQL setup
