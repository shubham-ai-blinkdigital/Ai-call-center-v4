Looking at the console logs and the screenshot, I can identify the root cause of the "Loading saved pathway..." issue on the /dashboard/pathway/14155321516 page.

Root Cause Analysis
Primary Issue: Infinite Loop in API Calls

From the console output, I can see that the same API endpoint /api/pathways/load-flowchart?pathwayId=5b9cbbed-71ac-424a-bed9-51441bdec107 is being called repeatedly every ~1.8 seconds in an infinite loop.

Contributing Factors:

useEffect Dependency Issue: In components/flowchart-builder/flowchart-canvas.tsx, there's likely a useEffect that's constantly re-triggering because of unstable dependencies or missing dependency array items.

State Update Loop: The flowchart canvas component is probably updating state that causes the component to re-render, which triggers the useEffect again, creating an infinite loop.

Missing Dependency Array or Incorrect Dependencies: The useEffect that loads the saved flowchart might be missing proper dependencies or has dependencies that change on every render.

Specific Problem Areas:

Looking at the flowchart canvas code, the issue is likely in this useEffect:

useEffect(() => {
  if (!pathwayInfo?.pathway_id) return
  const loadSavedFlowchart = async () => {
    // ... API call logic
  }
  loadSavedFlowchart()
}, [pathwayInfo?.pathway_id, initialNodes, initialEdges, setNodes, setEdges])
Potential Issues:

setNodes and setEdges are functions that might be recreated on every render
initialNodes and initialEdges might be objects that are recreated on every render
The component might be re-mounting repeatedly
Secondary Issues:

The loading state (isLoadingFlowchart) might not be properly managed
The API response might be causing state updates that trigger re-renders
The parent component might be passing unstable props
Impact:

Excessive API calls (every 1.8 seconds)
Poor user experience with constant "Loading saved pathway..." message
Potential performance issues and increased server load
Database connection pool exhaustion
The fix would involve stabilizing the useEffect dependencies, properly managing the loading state, and ensuring the component doesn't re-mount unnecessarily.
