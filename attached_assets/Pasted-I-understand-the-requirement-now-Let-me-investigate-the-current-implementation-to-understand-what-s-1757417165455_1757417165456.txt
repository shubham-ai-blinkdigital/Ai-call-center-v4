I understand the requirement now! Let me investigate the current implementation to understand what's happening:

Current Situation Analysis
Looking at the codebase, I can see that:

/dashboard/call-history page is fetching call data directly from Bland.ai API in real-time using the useUserCallData hook
Database tables exist for storing call data (the calls table in scripts/create-postgres-tables.sql)
Sync services are implemented but there seems to be a disconnect
Key Issues Identified
1. Data Flow Problem
The /dashboard/call-history page uses useUserCallData hook which calls Bland.ai API directly
The sync service exists but the call history page is NOT using the synced database data
Instead, it's fetching fresh data from Bland.ai every time
2. Sync Service Implementation Gap
Looking at services/call-sync-service.ts, I see:

✅ fetchCallsFromBland() - fetches from API
✅ syncCallToDatabase() - saves to database
✅ syncCallsForUser() - syncs user's calls
⚠️ But the call history page doesn't use this synced data
3. API vs Database Inconsistency
app/api/calls/sync/route.ts has sync endpoints
But app/dashboard/call-history/page.tsx bypasses the database entirely
The page should be reading from the synced database, not making live API calls
Root Cause
The call history page is designed to hit Bland.ai API directly instead of reading from the synced database. This means:

No persistence of call data
Slower page loads
API rate limits could be hit
No offline capability
Loss of data if Bland.ai is down
Required Solution
We need to:

Modify the call history page to read from the database instead of Bland.ai API
Ensure the sync service is properly populating the database
Create database queries that match the current API response format
Add automatic sync so data stays current
The end result should be:

Call history page shows the same data (but from database)
Faster page loads
Data persists even if Bland.ai is temporarily unavailable
Background sync keeps data fresh
Do you want me to proceed with implementing these fixes to make the call history page use the synced database data instead of live API calls?
