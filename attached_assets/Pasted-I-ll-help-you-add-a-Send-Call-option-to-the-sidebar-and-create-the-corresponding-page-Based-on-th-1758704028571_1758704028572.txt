I'll help you add a "Send Call" option to the sidebar and create the corresponding page. Based on the images you provided, I can see you want to add it below "Analytics" and create a page similar to Bland.ai's call interface.

Let me first update the sidebar to add the "Send Call" option:

components/dashboard/dashboard-sidebar.tsx
Now let me create the Send Call page at app/dashboard/sendcall/page.tsx:

app/dashboard/sendcall/page.tsx
Now I need to update the API route to handle the additional parameters:

app/api/bland-ai/send-test-call/route.ts
I've successfully added the "Send Call" option to the sidebar and created a comprehensive Send Call page that matches the design you provided. Here's what I implemented:

Changes Made:
Updated Sidebar: Added "Send Call" navigation item below "Analytics" in the dashboard sidebar

Created Send Call Page: Built a complete page at /dashboard/sendcall with:

Phone number input with country code selector
Voice selection dropdown
Toggle between Prompt and Pathway modes
Quick prompt templates (Telehealth, Small business, etc.)
Textarea for custom prompts
Live JavaScript code preview panel
Send call functionality
Enhanced API: Updated the send-test-call API to handle:

Optional voice ID parameter
Support for both pathway and task-based calls
Proper call configuration matching Bland.ai standards
Features Included:
Responsive Design: Split layout with form on left, code preview on right
Real-time Code Preview: Shows the actual API call being made
Voice Integration: Fetches and displays available voices
Pathway Integration: Loads user pathways for selection
Validation: Proper form validation and error handling
Toast Notifications: Success/error feedback
Loading States: Proper loading indicators
The page now provides a complete interface for sending calls with either custom prompts or existing pathways, matching the Bland.ai interface you showed in the images.

Yes, I understand your request perfectly!

Looking at the current Send Call page and the API documentation you provided, along with the attached screenshots showing the desired UI, I can see that you want me to:

Enhance the current Send Call page to support the full Bland.ai API with all its parameters

Add comprehensive UI sections similar to the screenshot you provided, including:

Basic settings (phone number, voice, prompt/pathway)
Model Settings (tune the model and language settings)
Dispatch Settings (transfer numbers and call duration)
Knowledge (add tools and pathways)
Audio (fine tune the audio of the call)
Voicemail Behavior (enable voicemail behavior for the call)
Analysis (specify the data you want to extract from the call)
Post Call (configure post call summaries and events)
Advanced (configure advanced settings for the call)
Update the API route (/api/bland-ai/send-test-call/route.ts) to handle all the new parameters from the full Bland.ai API

Maintain the existing functionality while expanding it significantly

Keep the code preview panel on the right side that dynamically updates based on user inputs

The current implementation is quite basic and only handles a few parameters like phone_number, voice_id, pathway_id, and task. You want me to expand it to support the full API with parameters like:

first_sentence, temperature, interruption_threshold
max_duration, background_track, noise_cancellation
transfer_phone_number, webhook, metadata
And many more advanced options
Should I proceed with implementing this comprehensive upgrade to the Send Call page?
